# HapSNPFlow
A collection of workflows for processing amplicon sequencing data to identify haplotypes and SNPs, enabling efficient genetic variant analysis.

The repository comprises two main branches corresponding to separate pipelines:

HaplotypR Workflow: Based on the publicly-available [HaplotypR](https://github.com/lerch-a/HaplotypR) pipeline. It can be used to reproduce results from previous studies or analyze new data with the same [published approach](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29132317/).
Alignment-Based Workflow: **under development**, employs an alignment-based approach to analyze amplicon sequencing data, identify SNPs, call haplotypes and includes additional resources to support data analysis for therapeutic efficacy studies.
